# Neural Network Mathematical Theory

As part of my bachelor's in mathematics, I had the fortune of discovering the concept of Neural Networks; these are mathematical structures that try to replicate the learning process to solve problems like Regression, Classification, and Clustering. This concept involved fields like Analysis, Statistics, Linear Algebra, etc. Additionally, the knowledge of programming in languages like Python or R.

As a purist mathematician, I already had experience in these fields, but the process of understanding how exactly neural networks work, requires time, curiosity, and perseverance. I intend to share my interpretation and finds in the literature.
