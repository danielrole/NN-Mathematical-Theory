# My Pathway in Data Science
## Visualization and Estimation in Beers Families
This project was born as my first try at answering a simple question based on data: How probable is one beer to like me as a function of my experience with another?

To be honest, this scripts have many baby steps, I consider them noteworthy due to all that they involve: Understanding a field, searching for data, cleaning this data, purpose a model, and explaining results was a rich experience.

* [01_Exploración de datos](https://github.com/danielrole/Portfolio/blob/main_1/Beers%20Families%20Visualization%20(Yed)/01_Exploraci%C3%B3n%20de%20datos.ipynb) is an initial approach to the dataset "Beers, Breweries, and Beer Reviews" obtained in Kaggle.

* [02_Código de identificación](https://github.com/danielrole/Portfolio/blob/main_1/Beers%20Families%20Visualization%20(Yed)/02_C%C3%B3digo%20de%20identificaci%C3%B3n.ipynb) addresses the relationship between the dataset seen in the last script and the categories of the Beer Judge Certification Program, and assigns a unique identification code to each observation.

* [03_Variables Categóricas](https://github.com/danielrole/Portfolio/blob/main_1/Beers%20Families%20Visualization%20(Yed)/03_Variables%20Categ%C3%B3ricas.ipynb) organizes each relation of beers, seen in the BJCP guidelines 2015, in a unique table by their identification code.

* [04_Red de Estilos](https://github.com/danielrole/Portfolio/blob/main_1/Beers%20Families%20Visualization%20(Yed)/04_Red%20de%20Estilos.ipynb), here we see the code for importing a Yed graph to visualize the relationships.

I got the opportunity to develop a model that estimates a range of reception, which likelihood is based on Bayesian theory, see here: [code](https://github.com/danielrole/Portfolio/blob/main_1/Beers%20Families%20Estimations%20(R)/Proyecto_Final_Robles_Leong_Daniel.R), [report](https://github.com/danielrole/Portfolio/blob/main_1/Beers%20Families%20Estimations%20(R)/Report.pdf)



## Long-Short Term Memory Approximation:
As Minsky & Papert share in their book perceptrons, these structures have deficiencies, move forward is to explore the architecture and training of Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks for the Regression Problem, Which is trying to reconstruct the original analytical function with noisy observations.

This project is the tracking of Multilayer approximation, developed in collaboration with Ph.D. student Gerardo Mártin Franco Cordova as part of my collaboration in SUPPORT PROGRAM FOR RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION PROJECTS.

## Introduction to Neural Network Structure
One initial approach to this concept is to understand Neural Networks' universality. These have different approximations, like George Cybenko theorem, proposed in 1989, using sigmoid and discriminant activation. This theorem proves that the Multilayer Perceptron approaches any continuous function as much as we want without ensuring complete convergence.

This notebook answer the question ¿Why does multilayer perceptron have this structure?. Explore an example of a neural network, and visualize the convergence with different activation functions.

This project was released for the Neural Networks Applications Seminar [2022-2](https://web.fciencias.unam.mx/docencia/horarios/detalles/333696). Taught by Dr. Humberto Andrés Carrillo Calvet, Director of the Laboratory of Nonlinear Dynamics, Department of Mathematics, Faculty of Sciences, UNAM.
