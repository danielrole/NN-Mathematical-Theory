#Long-Short Term Memory Approximation:

As Minsky & Papert share in their book perceptrons, these structures have deficiencies. A move forward is to explore the architecture and training of Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks for the Regression Problem, Which is trying to reconstruct the original analytical function with noisy observations.

This project is the tracking of Multilayer approximation, developed in collaboration with Ph.D. student Gerardo MÃ¡rtin Franco Cordova as part of my collaboration in SUPPORT PROGRAM FOR RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION PROJECTS.
